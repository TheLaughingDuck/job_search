# Job Searching
Manage your job applications via UI-widget and SQLite database. relevant job listings are automatically scraped and retrieved through TheirStack (requires signing up for free).

# Background
Being in the process of applying for jobs, and having to wade through many applications, I decided to streamline my process. My system first queries the [TheirStack Job API](https://app.theirstack.com) for relevant jobs and saves the retrieved listings in a SQLite database.

# Versions
## Version 1
Compiled version, executable on windows machines. In the recent releases I've also implemented a bunch of useful features.

## Version 0
Very specific setup that just worked on my machine. Just a local .pyw script that I ran on my desktop.
